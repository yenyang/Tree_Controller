# Patch v1.6.5
* Updated localization.
* Fixed minor incompatibility with Asset Icon Library v3.1 which made multiple vegetation prefabs selected not have selected highlight.
* Fix vanilla age buttons being shown sometimes.
* Added hidden setting for previously selected tree age so when you open game selected ages match what they were when you closed the game.
* Improved use of Add object menu for selecting multiple vegetation prefabs. Issues still present.
